# PyBer_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The DataFrame and graph will be used to compare quantity and fares of rides in every city type including urban, suburban, and rural. The goal is to create clear visualization and provide a proposal to the CEO for addressing any discrepancies among the city types.

## Summary
Here are three business recomendations addressing the disparities among the three city types.
- -	Increasing the cost of rides in the urban cities will result in surpluses because there is a much larger use of PyBer in urban cities. 
-	Increasing the number of drivers in the suburban and rural cities will reduce wait time resulting in an increase of riders.
-	Decreasing the cost of rides in the suburban and rural cities will encourage more consumers to use the PyBer service.
